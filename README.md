# The Discord Blue Jay Bot



Flying high in the sky\
Looking down, making sure everything is safe and sound\

Moderation\
-kicks\
-bans\
-warns\
-reports\

Fun\
-pranks\
-spams\
-rock paper scissors (?????)\
-rickroll link generator (!!!!)\

Now, do some quick math:\
Moderation + Fun + At the same time = Blue Jay Bot



Why we are different:\
-We are nice devs (crticism allowed in the help/support server)\
-No such thing as premium/VIP etc. Not everyone can pay money, so we all have same perks, but supporters get extra perks (supporting doesn't cost money or time, really)


----BOUNS----\
How to become a supporter:\
Since we cannot pay money, how do we support you?\
1. Join the Gamer House server (help+support)\
2. Give suggestions and feedback (criticism)\
3. Invite the bot to your servers (expand it)\
\
-Special requests and customization allowed:\
--Verification process for your server (+verify): set up here
https://forms.gle/VHRNszKpAXJi5DT28\
\
--Custom commands! (only supporters, not guaranteed)\
--Become a contributor (give really good suggestions, report errors that really need to be fixed ASAP)\
--Become a bot admin (help with the ideas and/or coding)\
\
\
\
\
And that's it! Here's the bottom line and summary of that big chunk of text:\
WE'RE THE BLUE JAY BOT!
